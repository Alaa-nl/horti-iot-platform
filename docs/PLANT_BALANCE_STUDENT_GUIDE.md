# Plant Balance Calculator - Student Guide

## Welcome Students!

This guide will help you understand how plants grow and what they need to be healthy. Think of plants as living factories that need the right conditions to work well!

## 🌱 What is Plant Balance?

Plant Balance is about understanding three main things:
1. **Assimilate Balance** - How plants make and use food
2. **Water Balance** - How plants manage water
3. **Energy Balance** - How plants handle heat and light

## 📚 Key Concepts Explained Simply

### Photosynthesis (Making Food)
- **What it is:** Plants use sunlight, CO2 from air, and water to make sugar (their food)
- **Think of it like:** A kitchen where plants cook their meals
- **What affects it:**
  - More light = more cooking (up to a point)
  - More CO2 = more ingredients
  - Right temperature (20-25°C) = perfect cooking conditions
  - Good humidity = kitchen doors (stomata) stay open

### Respiration (Using Energy)
- **What it is:** Plants "breathe" and burn sugar for energy, just like we do!
- **Think of it like:** A car burning fuel to run
- **What affects it:**
  - Higher temperature = burns more fuel
  - Night time = still burning fuel (no photosynthesis)

### Net Assimilation (Plant Profit)
- **What it is:** What's left after subtracting energy use from energy production
- **Think of it like:** Income - Expenses = Savings
- **Formula:** Photosynthesis - Respiration = Growth

## 💧 Water Management

### Transpiration
- **What it is:** Water evaporating from leaves
- **Think of it like:** Plant sweating to cool down
- **Benefits:**
  - Cools the plant
  - Pulls nutrients up from roots
  - Keeps stomata open for CO2

### Root Water Uptake
- **What it is:** How roots drink water from soil
- **Best conditions:**
  - Root temperature: 18-22°C
  - Not too wet (drowning)
  - Not too dry (thirsty)

## 🔍 Important Measurements

### VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit)
- **Simple explanation:** How thirsty the air is
- **Optimal range:** 0.8-1.2 kPa
- **Too low (<0.5):** Air too humid, disease risk
- **Too high (>2.0):** Air too dry, plants stressed

### PAR Light
- **What it is:** The light plants can actually use (not all light is useful!)
- **Measured in:** μmol/m²/s
- **Good levels:**
  - Low light plants: 100-200
  - Most vegetables: 400-600
  - High light plants: 600-800+

### CO2 Levels
- **Normal air:** 400 ppm
- **Enriched greenhouse:** 800-1000 ppm
- **Effect:** Double CO2 can increase growth by 30%!

## 📊 Using the Dashboard

### Step 1: Choose What to Study
- **Assimilate Balance:** Focus on photosynthesis and growth
- **Water Balance:** Focus on water management
- **Energy Balance:** Focus on temperature and heat

### Step 2: Adjust Parameters
Use the sliders to see how changes affect the plant:
- **Light slider:** Simulate sunrise to full sun
- **CO2 slider:** Compare normal air vs enriched
- **Temperature slider:** Find the sweet spot
- **Humidity slider:** See water stress effects

### Step 3: Observe Results
- **Green numbers:** Good conditions
- **Yellow numbers:** Getting stressed
- **Red numbers:** Problem conditions

## 🎯 Learning Activities

### Activity 1: Find the Optimal Conditions
1. Start with all parameters at medium values
2. Adjust one at a time
3. Find the best combination for maximum net assimilation
4. Write down your findings

### Activity 2: Simulate Day vs Night
1. Set light to 0 (night)
2. Observe respiration continues
3. Increase light gradually (sunrise)
4. Note when photosynthesis exceeds respiration

### Activity 3: Understanding RTR
1. Check the RTR value (expected temperature increase)
2. RTR = Daily Light Integral × 0.2°C/mol
3. Example: 17.3 mol/m²/day × 0.2 = 3.46°C expected increase
4. This tells you how much warmer the greenhouse should be with this light level

### Activity 3: Water Stress Simulation
1. Set humidity very low (30%)
2. Observe high VPD effect
3. Notice reduced photosynthesis
4. Understand why plants close stomata when dry

## 💡 Quick Tips

- **Optimal growing conditions:**
  - Light: 400-600 μmol/m²/s
  - CO2: 800-1000 ppm
  - Temperature: 22-25°C day, 18-20°C night
  - Humidity: 60-70%
  - VPD: 0.8-1.2 kPa

- **Common problems:**
  - Too hot + dry = stomata close = less photosynthesis
  - Too humid = disease risk
  - Too cold = slow everything
  - No light = only respiration (using stored energy)

## 🤔 Think About It

1. Why do greenhouses add CO2?
2. Why do plants wilt on hot, dry days?
3. Why is root temperature important?
4. What happens to a plant in complete darkness?
5. Why do we ventilate greenhouses?

## 📝 Take-Home Message

Plants are like athletes - they need:
- The right fuel (CO2 and light)
- The right temperature (not too hot, not too cold)
- Enough water (but not drowning)
- Good air conditions (not too dry, not too humid)

When all these factors are balanced, plants grow strong and productive!
